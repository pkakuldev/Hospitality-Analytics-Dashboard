> 🚀 **Hospitality Analytics Dashboard** :

Analyze hospitality performance data to track key KPIs, monitor revenue, occupancy, customer trends, and identify growth opportunities across properties, regions, booking channels, and customer segments.

📝**Description/Purpose** :

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing hospitality industry data to provide insights into total revenue, average daily rate (ADR), RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room), occupancy rates, customer booking patterns, and seasonal performance trends.

The dashboard enables real-time tracking of MTD/PMTD revenue, identifying high- and low-performing properties, and supports data-driven decision-making for revenue management, marketing, and operations.

🧰**Tech Stack** :

• Microsoft Excel → Data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing.

• SQL → Data extraction, cleaning, and aggregations.

• Power BI → Dashboard design and visualization.
 
• DAX Measures → For calculated KPIs (Revenue, Occupancy, ADR, RevPAR, MTD/PMTD comparisons)

• Data Validation via SQL/Excel → Cross-checking KPIs for accuracy.

📌**Feature and Highlights**
